# Monday Change - Bug Fixes

## Issue 1: Configuration Bug Fix
**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Error:** `AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'lower'`

### Problem Description
The application was failing when `get_config_value()` returned `None` or a boolean value, but the code was attempting to call `.lower()` method on it, which only works for strings.

### Root Cause
In `config.py`, the functions `get_app_settings()` and `get_feature_flags()` were directly calling `.lower()` on the return value of `get_config_value()` without checking if it was a string or handling `None` values.

### Solution Implemented
Added a helper function `parse_bool()` in both `get_app_settings()` and `get_feature_flags()` functions that:
1. Checks if the value is `None` and returns a default boolean
2. Checks if the value is already a boolean and returns it as-is
3. Converts the value to string and checks if it equals "true" (case-insensitive)

### Files Modified
- `/Users/apple/Documents/Streamlit/Excel-clean/config.py`
  - Updated `get_app_settings()` function (lines 71-86)
  - Updated `get_feature_flags()` function (lines 89-105)

## Issue 2: S3 Bucket Access Error
**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Error:** `botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (403) when calling the HeadBucket operation: Forbidden`

### Problem Description
The application was crashing when trying to check or create an S3 bucket due to insufficient permissions or bucket naming conflicts.

### Root Cause
The `create_bucket_if_not_exists()` function in `aws_s3_service.py` was not handling 403 Forbidden errors gracefully. This error occurs when:
1. AWS credentials don't have sufficient permissions
2. The bucket name already exists and is owned by another AWS account
3. The bucket exists but we only have limited permissions (e.g., PutObject but not HeadBucket)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Modified `aws_s3_service.py`:**
   - Added graceful handling for 403 Forbidden errors
   - Function now returns a boolean status instead of raising exceptions
   - When 403 is encountered, the code logs a warning but continues operation
   - Added checks for S3 client initialization before operations

2. **Modified `streamlit_demo.py`:**
   - Changed button text from "Upload & Store in S3" to "Upload & Process"
   - Added try-catch wrapper around S3 operations
   - Made S3 storage optional - app continues working even if S3 fails
   - Added fallback to local processing when S3 is unavailable
   - Improved error messages to be more user-friendly

### Files Modified
- `/Users/apple/Documents/Streamlit/Excel-clean/aws_s3_service.py`
  - Updated `create_bucket_if_not_exists()` function (lines 48-91)
  
- `/Users/apple/Documents/Streamlit/Excel-clean/streamlit_demo.py`
  - Updated upload handling (lines 1427-1480)
  - Added S3 failure handling with local fallback

### Key Improvements
1. Application no longer crashes when S3 is unavailable
2. Users can still process files locally without S3
3. Clear feedback when S3 operations fail
4. Graceful degradation of functionality

## Testing
Successfully tested both fixes by:
1. Running `streamlit run streamlit_demo.py` - application starts without errors
2. Uploading a file - works even when S3 permissions are insufficient
3. File processing continues locally when S3 is unavailable
